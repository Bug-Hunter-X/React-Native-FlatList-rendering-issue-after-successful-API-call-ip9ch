# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where a React Native FlatList component fails to render data after a successful API call. The issue is intermittent and not consistently reproducible, making it challenging to diagnose.

## Bug Description
The app fetches data from a remote API.  While the API call is successful and the data is available, the FlatList component remains empty. The problem doesn't occur every time and seems related to timing or state management inconsistencies.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the app using `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
3. Observe that the FlatList sometimes renders correctly and sometimes remains blank despite data being successfully fetched from the API.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring the data is consistently updated in the FlatList's state after the API call, and potentially adding error handling mechanisms and more robust state management.
